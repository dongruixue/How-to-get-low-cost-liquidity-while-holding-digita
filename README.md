#  How to get low-cost liquidity while holding digital assets?

Do you have this confusion, on the one hand, you are determined to hold digital assets for a long time, and on the other hand, you are thinking that digital assets cannot do the same as traditional assets, and bring liquidity while holding them?

In fact, if you find a safe and suitable platform to pledge digital assets, you can obtain extremely low-cost liquidity. “Pando leaf" (URL: https://leaf.pando.im/) is a decentralized product that generates stable coins by pledging digital assets.

Pando leaf currently supports the following trading pairs

**The following are the steps for collateralized borrowing with BTC/pUSD as an example.**

1. Download Mixin app ([Mixin](https://mixin.one/messenger)) and complete KYC real name registration. 
   Mixin Messenger is an instant messaging app and decentralized wallet that uses Signal's protocol to encrypt messages.
   There are many bots in Mixin Messenger, for example, [pando leaf] has a bot in Messenger, you can search for "7000103924" to access it.
2. Deposit your pre-pledged assets into Mixin wallet
3. Open the URL: https://leaf.pando.im/ , open Mixin wallet sweep connection, or directly add the bot 7000103924 on Mixin APP
4. [add vault]
5. [deposit] BTC means collateral BTC
6. [mint] means borrowing (it is recommended that the leverage does not exceed 20%)
7. Deposit assets to generate.

Up to here, we mortgage BTC to borrow pUSD, check Mixin wallet.

Check Mixin wallet, you can see the wallet BTC decrease pUSD (liquidity) increase, at this point the borrowed money (pUSD) can be used to go reinvest/spend, it’s up to you.



**Repayment steps are as follows.**

1. Open the website: https://leaf.pando.im/, open Mixin wallet sweep connection, or directly search for "7000103924" on Mixin APP to access it
2. Find My Vault
3. Click [Repayment] - the principal and interest pUSD (more interest than the original borrowed) to pay off simultaneously
4. Get back the full amount of the collateral BTC

This way, a borrower will complete a closed-loop operation, at this time you can return to Mixin wallet to see the full amount of the mortgage BTC returned.

The amount of pUSD returned = the borrowed pUSD + 5% annualized interest rate (different transaction pairs have different interest rates)



**Caution ⚠️**

1. Mortgage rate = (number of collateralized assets x current price) / number of loans x 100%
2. Leverage = number of loans / (number of collateralized assets x current price) = 1/Mortgage rate
3. It is recommended that the leverage ratio does not exceed 20%, and it is recommended that the assets coming from the loan do not recycle the operation
4. Collateral assets fall to the liquidation price will automatically liquidate to auction.



I hope the above will be helpful to you.
